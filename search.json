    "text": "Data visualization\nStudents will create a preliminary chart adressing a relevant problem of economic policy for an in-class presentation. The presentation should provide an intuition of the research question, the underlying data of the chart and considerations behind the style of the chart. The time slot for the presentation is five minutes. Afterwards we will have a brief Q&A in class. The presentation should only have a small number of slides with little text to lead the audience through the process of chart creation, e.g.\n\nResearch question: Which issue in economic policy do you want to address with your chart?\nData: What data did you use?\nChart: What does the chart show? What were your thoughts when choosing this style?\nConclusion: What can we learn from this data visualization for economic policy?\n\n\n\nRMarkdown report\nStudents are required to draft a short report around the chart, containing the economic policy background and the most important information about chart creation. The final version of the report is due on January 31, 2025. You should work with RMarkdown (or Quarto) which is a handy and simple tool to compose reports based on R code. It is recommended to edit the document in RStudio and compile it in HTML format. The final report should be structured as follows:\n\nIntroduction: Explain why the topic you chose is important and interesting for the academic/public debate.\nResearch question: What is the specific research question that you want to address with your visualization?\nData: What data did you use? What are the limitations of the data? If helpful, you might want to include some descriptive statistics as a table.\nResult: Present and describe the chart that you have created.\nConclusion: What are the policy conclusions of your chart?\nCode: Provide the full code for your data visualization as a code block in the appendix of the report.\n\n\n\nCheatsheets\n   \n\n\nAdditional online resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKieran Healy  Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction  Princeton University Press  ISBN-13: 9780691181622  Link\n\n\n\nClaus O.

This course approaches contemporary issues of economic policy by analyzing innovative and iconic data visualizations. Based on selected illustrations, we discuss the underlying data, the theoretical background and policy implications with a focus on the nexus between inequality and economic growth. In a second step, we will assemble plots in class and study the basics of data visualization for policy design and evaluation. Students are required to recreate figures at home to improve their skills in coding. The main task is that students will design a comprehensive data visualization in R and draft a report around that figure in RMarkdown (or Quarto). Student will need to bring their laptop to class and prior knowledge of data handling in R is beneficial.\n  \nTo sum up, students will gain:\n\n\nan overview of contemporary debates in economic policy based on recent empirical research\nan understanding of the basics of data visualization for policy design and evaluation\nknowledge how to enrich academic journal publications with informative figures"

As the graphic illustration of statistical data gains in importance in both the academic and the public discourse, students will learn best practices and gain insights into the visualization of data. Another take-away of the course is to strengthen the knowledge about the power and limitations of the underlying data of empirical economic policy. A part of each session is dedicated to the work with data. The lecturer provides R-code to produce figures in class. Studens are expected to recreate three charts at home. The main assignment is the production of a comprehensive data visualization on a selected topic of economic policy. Studens will present their chart in class and draft a report with a detailed description of the data, the code and the final visualization in RMarkdown.\nThe course offers a lot of room for discussion in order to permit students to assess various arguments and perspectives, form their own opinion, and argue in a group setting. The teaching is designed to encourage students to actively participate in the debates, raise questions, and gain experience in visualizing data for academic publications or the general debate.\n\n\nRecommended literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Schwabish  Better Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks  Columbia University Press  ISBN-13: 9780231193115  Link\n\n\n\nDavid Spiegelhalter  The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data  Penguin Books UK  ISBN-13: 9780241258767  Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\nAfter completing this course, students will:\n\nknow key figures in various fields of economic policy\nbe aware of potentials and limitations of available data in specific policy areas\nshow improved programming skills in R and the ability to create an RMarkdown report\nhave basic knowledge of important principles of data visualization\nbe able to create simple charts to enrich their academic articles\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments: 30% (0-10 points for each visualization)\n\n\n\nChart presentation: 30% (0-20 points for the quality of the presentation, 0-10 for the preliminary chart)\n\n\n\nWritten report: 40% (0-40 points for the report and the final chart)\n\n\n\n\n   100-90: Excellent      89-80: Good      79-65: Satisfactory      64-50: Sufficient\nAll single tasks have to be passed (50% threshold each)."
